# 100DaysofCoding-Day8-Challenge-CaeserCypher

The goal of this project was creating an encoder and a decoder based on the caesers cypher. It involved creating functions with preset parameters and executing them at the end. The hardest part was defing the functions which incorporated multiple concepts from previous projects. Overall fun and informative.
